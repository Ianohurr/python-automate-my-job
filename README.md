I'm going to try and make a program that helps me with my IT job

I work in IT currently, so I'm going to attempt to make a binary tree flow chart for diagnosing a customers problem.
I'm going to try and make it dynamic, so if I get to the end of the tree without having found the problem, I can add to the
tree. Again, I don't know python that well, which is why I'm making this on python so I can learn. The reason I'm saying that
is because I don't know what the best way to go about this is, so my current idea might be over-complicated. I'm basically going
to have a text file set up on the cloud that holds all the information for this binary tree and when I get to the end of the binary
tree, I'm going to append that txt file with the new info I want for the tree. The reason I'm doing this with a file is because
I want to be able to have the tree be bigger everytime I open it. I've done projects before where I cna add to a binary tree,
but it always starts at the same point. I want this one to start with more every time it is opened.
